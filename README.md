# GenoMLizer


# Desciption
A machine learning pipeline for prioritizing variants as genetic modifiers of rare disorders.

The goal of GenoMLizer is to help identify and prioritize genomic variants associated with disesase, specifically genetic modifiers of rare disorder.

GenoMLizer takes in variant data from whole genome or exome squencing in a VCF file and performs feature selection using several available techniques that are optimizable to each analysis, and then assesses the variants (features) ability to predict disease/symptome/phenotype status by fitting several machine learning models. The output of GenoMLizer includes predictive performance metrics for each model tested, along with a permutation-based variable importance assessment for each model's variables. 


Two available pipelines

# Getting Started

## Installation

-install procedure
-requirements
  -mention if install does not work will have to meet requirements another way such as virtual environment with conda
-bcftools
-vep process with example
